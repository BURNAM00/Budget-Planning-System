#  Budget Planning System

##  Objective

Provide personalized monthly budget suggestions based on a user's income and expenses using proportional allocation and rule-based financial guidance.

---

##  Computational Techniques

1. **Proportional Allocation** ‚Äì Uses budgeting rules such as 50/30/20 and 60/10/10/10/10 to distribute income across essential categories.
2. **Rule-Based Guidance** ‚Äì Provides spending, savings, and debt-reduction advice based on established financial guidelines.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface (Flask + Bootstrap + Chart.js)

* Input fields for total monthly income and expenses
* Interactive pie chart for budget visualization
* Breakdown of allocations vs. benchmark data
* Rule-based financial advice and category-specific tips

---

##  Types of Datasets Used

1. **Household Spending Patterns** ‚Äì For benchmarking allocations by income bracket
2. **Financial Planning Guidelines** ‚Äì For rule-based advice and savings/debt strategies
